# Benjamin Franklin vs. Michael Jordan

Let's play a quick game since we all need to finish the angular tutorial and we all need to learn github.

Benjamin Franklin and Michael Jordan have decided to play a game of one-on-one basketball with an unusual provision. More about the provision later.

First, let's split into two teams of two. I suggest that it would be more fun not to be on a team where your name and your partner's name could form the string "Benjamin Franklin" or "Michael Jordan". If your team has that solved, you are ready to play.

Now, in order for the ball to go in the basket, your team must do two things:

1. One partner completes and commits an angular tutorial module (there are six total) to a new github branch.
2. The other partner merges it to the development branch.
3. The roles swap for the next module.

Each member of a winning team will have completed three modules and pulled three merge requests.

The results should be easily tallied on github.

Anyone game?
