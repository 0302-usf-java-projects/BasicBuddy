## Style Guide

Now that a majority have checked in, let's work on keeping file names consistent. The MASTER branch to this repository shows three versions of README.md:

	readme.md
	README.MD
	README.md

Since we want new users to notice the `README` file, using uppercase is a nice convention because it sets up a distinct typographic hierarchy. We also adopt this for other 'INSTALL', 'AUTHORS', 'COPYING', 'TODO', 'NEWS', and 'CHANGELOG', as detailed on StackExchange[1].
